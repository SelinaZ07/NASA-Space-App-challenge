**Summary:**

Our project is a web application that displays the 608 NASA bioscience publications in a summary form to allow potential users to comprehend them more easily, and enables users to explore the impacts, findings, and next steps through the search bar.
We also displayed interactive visualizations showing the amount of research in different areas and existing gaps between the studied areas. Currently, although there have been numerous scientific breakthroughs through in-space experiments, potential users find it difficult to find information about their specific interests and comprehend the results. With our solution, the publications are presented much more organized, and specifically with the AI chatbot that we created, the users can explore the publications faster and more efficiently.

There are **6 pages** on the website:

- *index.html* : is the file for the about page. In this page, we provided an overview of our project as well as 3 highlighting articles.
- *visuals.html* : is the file for the visual page, where we displayed our main visualizations on the 608 NASA bioscience research publications that were provided. 
- *future.html*: this file is the future direction page. In it, we displayed a mindmap showcasing current research focus areas using the information we got from the NASA task book.
- *publications.html*: Here, we provided 50 of the NASA bioscience publications given. The search bar allows the user to search for specific publications, and they can use the filter to filter based on 10 different categories. In each research paper's block, we provided the summary, purpose, approach, key findings, impact, and next steps of the paper.
- *resources.html*: On this page, we provided some additional websites that the users may find helpful.
